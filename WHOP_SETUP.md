# 🚀 Official Whop SDK Integration Setup

## ✅ What's Implemented

**Official Whop SDK Integration** using `@whop/api` package:
- OAuth flow initiation via `/.netlify/functions/auth-whop-init`
- OAuth callback handling via `/.netlify/functions/auth-whop-callback`
- Automatic subscription verification
- User-friendly success/error pages
- Seamless dashboard integration

## 📋 Environment Variables Required

Add these to your **Netlify Environment Variables**:

### ✅ Already Have:
```env
WHOP_API_KEY=TcfGCsp0... (your existing key)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID=your-company-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=your-app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID=your-agent-user-id
```

### ⚠️ Still Need (for client-side):
```env
VITE_WHOP_APP_ID=your-app-id (same as NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID)
VITE_WHOP_COMPANY_ID=your-company-id (same as NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID)
```

## 🔧 Whop Dashboard Setup

### 1. Configure OAuth App in Whop Dashboard:
1. Go to your Whop Developer Dashboard
2. Find your app settings
3. Add **Redirect URI**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/auth/whop-callback`
4. Ensure **Scopes** include: `read_user`, `read_memberships`

### 2. Update Netlify Environment:
Add the new `VITE_` prefixed variables to match your existing ones.

## 🎯 User Flow

1. **User clicks "Connect with Whop"** → Redirects to `/.netlify/functions/auth-whop-init`
2. **OAuth initiation** → Redirects to Whop OAuth page
3. **User authorizes** → Whop redirects to `/.netlify/functions/auth-whop-callback`
4. **Backend verifies subscription** → Redirects to success/error page
5. **User gets premium access** → Dashboard updates automatically

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Flow:
1. **Register/Login** to your QuantEdgeB account
2. **Go to Dashboard**
3. **Click "Connect with Whop"**
4. **Authorize on Whop**
5. **Should redirect back with premium access**

### Debug URLs:
- **OAuth Init**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/auth-whop-init?token=YOUR_JWT`
- **Test Whop API**: `https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/test-whop`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid redirect URI"**:
   - Check Whop dashboard redirect URI matches exactly
   - Ensure `https://` (not `http://`)

2. **"Insufficient permissions"**:
   - Verify app has `read_user` and `read_memberships` scopes
   - Check API key permissions in Whop dashboard

3. **"No valid subscription"**:
   - User needs active subscription to your products
   - Check company ID matches in environment

### Check Logs:
```bash
# Netlify function logs will show detailed errors
# Check: Site Dashboard > Functions > View logs
```

## 🎉 What Users See

### Before Connection:
- Dashboard shows "Connect Your Whop Account" section
- Manual email verification option available

### After Connection:
- "Premium Access Active" badge
- Access to premium content
- No need for manual verification

This is now using the **official Whop SDK** and follows Whop's recommended OAuth flow!
